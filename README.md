This Sinatra-based webapp facilitates migration from Cisco "enterprise" phone firmware (Ent) to mutliplatform phone firmware (MPP).  Ent firmware is used when devices register to Cisco on-premises call control platforms such as Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM), Communications Manager Express (CME) or Business Edition 4000 (BE4K).  MPP firmware is used when registering phones to Cisco Webex Calling, Cisco BroadCloud Calling, BroadCloud, BroadWorks or other third-party SIP call control.
